```

⏺ Great! The build succeeded and the program ran correctly, outputting "c23". Let me mark the task as completed:

⏺ Fixed! The issues were:

  1. Removed deprecated -fmodules-ts flag - This flag is no longer needed with C++23 as modules support is automatic
  2. Fixed system header paths - Added -isysroot with the macOS SDK path to find system headers
  3. Removed invalid <priority_queue> import - This header doesn't exist, priority_queue is in <queue>
  4. Used proper CMake module setup - Used FILE_SET CXX_MODULES to properly declare module files

  Your C++23 modules project now builds and runs successfully!
