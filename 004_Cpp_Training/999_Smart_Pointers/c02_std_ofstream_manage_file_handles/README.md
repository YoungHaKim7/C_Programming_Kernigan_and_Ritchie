=== std::ifstream File Handle Management Demo ===
This demonstrates RAII principles for file handling

=== Basic File Reading ===
Line 1: Hello, World!
Line 2: This is a sample text file for demonstrating std::ifstream file handle management.
Line 3: Line 3: C++ provides excellent RAII support for file handling.
Line 4: Line 4: Files are automatically closed when std::ifstream objects go out of scope.
Line 5: Line 5: This makes memory and resource management much safer and easier.
Line 6: Line 6: No need to manually remember to close files!
Line 7: Final line of the sample file.
File closed automatically

=== RAII File Handling ===
File opened: sample.txt
File is open: Yes
File content (400 chars):
Hello, World!
This is a sample text file for demonstrating std::ifstream file handle management.
Line 3: C++ provides excellent RAII support for file handling.
Line 4: Files are automatically closed when std::ifstream objects go out of scope.
Line 5: This makes memory and resource management much safer and easier.
Line 6: No need to manually remember to close files!
Final line of the sample file.

File closed: sample.txt
FileReader object out of scope - file automatically closed

=== Smart Pointer File Handling ===
File opened: sample.txt
Read 7 lines:
  [1] Hello, World!
  [2] This is a sample text file for demonstrating std::ifstream file handle management.
  [3] Line 3: C++ provides excellent RAII support for file handling.
  [4] Line 4: Files are automatically closed when std::ifstream objects go out of scope.
  [5] Line 5: This makes memory and resource management much safer and easier.
  [6] Line 6: No need to manually remember to close files!
  [7] Final line of the sample file.
Unique_ptr going out of scope - file automatically closed
File closed: sample.txt

=== File Position Operations ===
First line: Hello, World!
Current position: 14
Reset to beginning, position: 0
Seek to end, position: 399
File size: 399 bytes

=== Error Handling ===
File open status: Closed
Fail bit: Set
Bad bit: Not set
File stream is in error state
Error state cleared

=== Binary File Reading ===
Read 399 bytes in binary mode
Content as string: Hello, World!
This is a sample text file for demonstrating std::ifstream file handle management.
Line 3: C++ provides excellent RAII support for file handling.
Line 4: Files are automatically closed when std::ifstream objects go out of scope.
Line 5: This makes memory and resource management much safer and easier.
Line 6: No need to manually remember to close files!
Final line of the sample file.

=== File Handle Management Summary ===
• std::ifstream automatically closes files when destructor is called
• RAII ensures files are properly closed even when exceptions occur
• Smart pointers provide additional safety for file management
• Always check file.is_open() after attempting to open a file
• Use try-catch blocks for proper error handling
• File streams support both text and binary modes
• seekg/tellg allow random access to file content
