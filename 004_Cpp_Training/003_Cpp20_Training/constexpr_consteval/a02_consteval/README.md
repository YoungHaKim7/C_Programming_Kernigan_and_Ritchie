=== C++20 consteval Examples ===
consteval functions MUST be evaluated at compile time

1. Basic consteval function:
   square(5) = 25 (evaluated at compile time)

2. consteval factorial:
   factorial(5) = 120 (evaluated at compile time)

3. consteval for compile-time validation:
   is_power_of_two(16) = 1
   is_power_of_two(15) = 0

4. consteval struct operations:
   Point p1(3, 4) + p2(1, 2) = (4, 6)
   Distance squared = 52

5. consteval for array generation:
   create_sequence<5>(10) = 10 11 12 13 14

6. consteval for string literal processing:
   string_length("Hello, consteval!") = 17

7. consteval for compile-time hash calculation:
   djb2_hash("consteval") = 2533058164

8. consteval for bit manipulation:
   count_set_bits(15) = 4 (binary: 1111)
   count_set_bits(8) = 1 (binary: 1000)

9. consteval for mathematical constants:
   calculate_pi() ≈ 3.14158
   Actual pi = 3.14159

10. consteval for type checking and validation:
    validate_type_requirements<ValidPod>() = 1
    (ValidPod is trivial and standard layout)

=== Key Differences between constexpr and consteval ===
- constexpr: Can be evaluated at compile time OR runtime
- consteval: MUST be evaluated at compile time only
- consteval provides stronger compile-time guarantees
- consteval functions can only be called in contexts requiring constant expressions

Note: Try calling a consteval function with runtime values - it won't compile!

# I've successfully created a comprehensive C++20 consteval example with 10 different examples as
- requested. Here's what I've implemented:

  10 C++20 consteval Examples:

  1. Basic consteval function - Simple square function that must be evaluated at compile time
  2. consteval factorial - Recursive factorial calculation with compile-time guarantee
  3. consteval for validation - Power of two checking for compile-time validation
  4. consteval struct operations - Point class with compile-time methods and operators
  5. consteval array generation - Template function to generate sequences at compile time
  6. consteval string processing - Calculate string length of string literals
  7. consteval hash calculation - DJB2 hash algorithm for compile-time string hashing
  8. consteval bit manipulation - Count set bits in integers at compile time
  9. consteval mathematical constants - Calculate π approximation using Leibniz formula
  10. consteval type validation - Check type properties using type traits

  The program demonstrates the key differences between constexpr and consteval, showing that consteval functions provide stronger compile-time
  guarantees and must be evaluated at compile time, not runtime.

  The output shows all 10 examples working correctly, with clear explanations of what each example demonstrates.
