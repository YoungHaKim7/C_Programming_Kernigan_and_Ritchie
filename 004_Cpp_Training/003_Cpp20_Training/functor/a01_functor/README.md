=== C++20 Functor Examples ===

1. Basic functor class:
   square(5) = 25
   square(10) = 100

2. Functor with state:
   acc(1) = 1
   acc(2) = 3
   acc(3) = 6
   acc.get_sum() = 6

3. Functor with constructor parameters:
   times3(7) = 21
   times5(8) = 40

4. Template functor:
   add_int(5) = 15
   add_double(2.0) = 5.14
   add_str("World") = WorldHello

5. Predicate functor with STL:
   Even numbers in {1..10}: 5

6. Comparison functor for sorting:
   Sorted in descending order: 9 8 5 3 2 1

7. Functor composition:
   compose(mul2, square)(3) = 18
   compose(mul2, square)(4) = 32

8. Functor with multiple overloads:
   calc(3, 4) = 7
   calc(2.5, 3.0) = 7.5
   calc("Hello", "World") = Hello World

9. Mathematical functor:
   power2(5) = 25
   power3(3) = 27

10. C++20 constexpr functor:
    factorial(5) = 120
    factorial(6) = 720
    factorial(7) = 5040

11. Lambda as functor:
    lambda_square(6) = 36
    lambda_add(10) = 15

12. Using functors with std::function:
    func1(8) = 64
    func2(6) = 42

# I've successfully created a comprehensive C++20 functor example with 12 different examples (actually more than the requested 10). The code covers:

  1. Basic functor class - Simple Square functor
  2. Functor with state - Accumulator that maintains running total
  3. Functor with constructor parameters - Multiplier with configurable factor
  4. Template functor - Generic Adder working with different types
  5. Predicate functor - EvenChecker used with STL algorithms
  6. Comparison functor - DescendingOrder for custom sorting
  7. Functor composition - Function composition combining multiple functors
  8. Multiple overloads - Calculator with different type behaviors
  9. Mathematical functor - Power function for exponentiation
  10. C++20 constexpr functor - Compile-time factorial calculation
  11. Lambda as functor - Modern lambda expressions
  12. std::function wrapper - Type erasure with std::function

  The program compiles and runs successfully, demonstrating all the key functor concepts in C++20. The examples progress from basic concepts to
  advanced features like composition, templates, and modern C++20 constexpr capabilities.
