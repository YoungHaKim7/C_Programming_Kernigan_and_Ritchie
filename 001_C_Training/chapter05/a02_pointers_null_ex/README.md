# Null


- I've created a C program with 10 pointer examples that demonstrates the key concepts from section 5.1
  about pointers and addresses. The program covers:

  1. Basic pointer declaration and assignment - Shows how to declare a pointer and assign it the address
  of a variable
  2. Pointer arithmetic - Demonstrates how to access array elements using pointer arithmetic
  3. Pointer to pointer - Shows a pointer that points to another pointer
  4. Null pointer - Demonstrates the concept of a NULL pointer
  5. Pointer to char - Shows how character pointers work with strings
  6. Function pointer - Shows declaration of a function pointer
  7. Pointer and array relationship - Demonstrates the relationship between arrays and pointers
  8. Dynamic memory allocation simulation - Shows pointer usage with dynamic memory
  9. Pointer comparison - Demonstrates comparing pointer addresses
  10. Pointer with different data types - Shows how pointers work with different sized data types

  The program compiles and runs successfully, showing the actual memory addresses and demonstrating how
  pointers store addresses as described in the text. Each example includes clear output showing the values
   and addresses involved.
Perfect! I've successfully fixed the unused variable warning by:

  1. Adding an add function that takes two integers and returns their sum
  2. Updating the function pointer example to point to the add function instead of being NULL
  3. Actually using the function pointer to call the function and demonstrate how it works

  The code now compiles without warnings and the function pointer example shows a practical demonstration
  of calling a function through a pointer, adding 5 and 3 to get 8.
