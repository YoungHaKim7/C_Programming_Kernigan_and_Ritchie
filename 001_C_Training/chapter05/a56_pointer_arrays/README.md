erfect! I have successfully implemented a comprehensive C program for Chapter 5.6 "Pointer Arrays; Pointers to Pointers" with the following
  components:

  Program Files Created:

  1. src/main.c - Main demonstration program with 10 comprehensive examples
  2. src/sort.c - The original sorting program from the textbook
  3. src/test.c - Comprehensive test suite with validation
  4. test_input.txt - Sample input for testing the sorting program
  5. interactive_test.sh - Script for interactive testing

  10 Examples Implemented:

  1. Basic Pointer Array Declaration - Shows how to declare and use arrays of character pointers
  2. Pointer Arrays with Dynamic Allocation - Demonstrates dynamic assignment to pointer arrays
  3. Sorting with Pointer Arrays - Complete sorting demonstration using pointer arrays
  4. Pointers to Pointers - Shows double pointer dereferencing and usage
  5. Memory Layout Demonstration - Visualizes how pointer arrays are stored in memory
  6. Pointer Arithmetic with Pointer Arrays - Shows pointer operations on pointer arrays
  7. Two-dimensional Arrays vs Pointer Arrays - Compares memory efficiency
  8. Command-line Arguments Simulation - Demonstrates argv-style usage
  9. Array of Function Pointers - Shows function pointer arrays
  10. Complete Sorting Program - Full implementation as described in the textbook

  Key Features:

  - Efficient Memory Usage: Uses pointer arrays to avoid copying large strings
  - Quicksort Implementation: Implements the textbook's quicksort algorithm
  - Memory Management: Custom allocator function for dynamic memory
  - Comprehensive Testing: Full test suite with edge cases and validation
  - Interactive Mode: Can read from stdin or files for sorting

  Test Results:

  All tests passed successfully:
  - ✅ Memory allocation and management
  - ✅ Pointer swapping operations
  - ✅ Quicksort algorithm correctness
  - ✅ Sorting with various string types
  - ✅ Edge cases (empty array, single element, duplicates)

  The implementation perfectly demonstrates the textbook's concepts: pointer arrays eliminate the "twin problems of complicated storage management
  and high overhead that would go with moving the lines themselves" by only swapping pointers rather than copying entire strings during sorting.


# Result

```bash
=== Chapter 5.5: Character Pointers and Functions ===

1. String Constants and Character Pointers:
   Pointer assignment: pmessage = "now is the time"
   printf with string constant: hello, world

2. Array vs Pointer Declaration:
   amessage[]: "now is the time"
  Address: 0x16dc4a4a0
  Length: 15
  Characters: 'n'(0x6e) 'o'(0x6f) 'w'(0x77) ' '(0x20) 'i'(0x69) 's'(0x73) ' '(0x20) 't'(0x74) 'h'(0x68) 'e'(0x65) ' '(0x20) 't'(0x74) 'i'(0x69) 'm'(0x6d) 'e'(0x65) '\0'(0x00)

   *pmessage2: "now is the time"
  Address: 0x1021b5400
  Length: 15
  Characters: 'n'(0x6e) 'o'(0x6f) 'w'(0x77) ' '(0x20) 'i'(0x69) 's'(0x73) ' '(0x20) 't'(0x74) 'h'(0x68) 'e'(0x65) ' '(0x20) 't'(0x74) 'i'(0x69) 'm'(0x6d) 'e'(0x65) '\0'(0x00)

3. Modifying Array vs Pointer:
   Modified amessage: "Now is the time"
   Reassigned pmessage2: "new string"

4. Testing strcpy Functions:
   strcpy_array_version: "Hello, C Programming!"
   strcpy_pointer_version1: "Hello, C Programming!"
   strcpy_pointer_version2: "Hello, C Programming!"
   strcpy_pointer_version3: "Hello, C Programming!"

5. Testing strcmp Functions:
   Comparing "apple" and "banana":
     strcmp_array_version: -1
     strcmp_pointer_version: -1
   Comparing "apple" and "apple":
     strcmp_array_version: 0
     strcmp_pointer_version: 0
   Comparing "banana" and "apple":
     strcmp_array_version: 1
     strcmp_pointer_version: 1

6. Multiple String Constants:
   messages[0]: "First message" (at 0x1021b58c8)
   messages[1]: "Second message" (at 0x1021b58d8)
   messages[2]: "Third message" (at 0x1021b58e8)
   messages[3]: "Last message" (at 0x1021b58f8)

7. String Manipulation with Pointers:
   Original: "Pointers are powerful"
   Character by character: Pointers are powerful

8. Manual String Length Calculation:
   String: "Calculate my length"
   Manual length: 19
   strlen() result: 19

9. String Concatenation:
   Result: "Hello, World!"

10. Standard Library vs Custom Functions:
    Standard strcpy: "Testing comparison"
    Custom strcpy: "Testing comparison"
    strcmp results: 0 (standard) vs 0 (custom)
```
