# Test
1. Using makepoint to initialize rectangles dynamically
  2. Computing center points using makepoint
  3. Adding points with addpoints
  4. Testing point inclusion with ptinrect
  5. Normalizing rectangles with canonrect
  6. Structure pointer access using -> vs (*pp).
  7. Rectangle pointer operations demonstrating equivalent access methods
  8. Operator precedence examples with ++p->len
  9. Complex pointer operations with strings in structures
  10. Structure copying and assignment
  11. Function calls with structures as parameters and return values
  12. Complex calculations using multiple structure operations

  Testing Infrastructure:

  - Automated test suite (test_structures.c) with assertions to verify all functionality
  - Makefile for easy compilation and testing
  - All tests pass successfully!

  The program perfectly demonstrates the concepts from Section 6.2 and provides a solid foundation for understanding how structures work with
  functions in C. You can run the examples with make run and run the tests with make test.
