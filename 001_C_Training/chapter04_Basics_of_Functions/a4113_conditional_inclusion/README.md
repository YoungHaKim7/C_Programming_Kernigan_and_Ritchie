- Perfect! I've created a main.c file with 10 example sentences that demonstrate macro substitution concepts. The program includes:

```
‚óè I've successfully added 10 examples demonstrating conditional inclusion (Examples 11-20) to the main program. The examples cover:

  1. Header guard pattern (#ifndef)
  2. Platform-specific code selection (#if, #elif, #else)
  3. Feature testing with defined()
  4. Arithmetic expression evaluation
  5. Multiple condition testing
  6. Nested conditional compilation
  7. Complex logical expressions
  8. Version control simulation
  9. Bit flag testing
  10. Optimization level simulation

```

- The examples demonstrate various conditional inclusion techniques from the textbook section 4.11.3, including `#if`, `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#elif`, `#else`, and the `defined()` operator.
