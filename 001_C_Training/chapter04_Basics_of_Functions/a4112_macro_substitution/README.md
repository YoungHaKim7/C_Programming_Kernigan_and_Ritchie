- Perfect! I've created a main.c file with 10 example sentences that demonstrate macro substitution concepts. The program includes:

```
1. Simple macro substitution (PI constant)
2. Infinite loop macro (FOREVER)
3. String message macro (MESSAGE)
4. Parameterized macro for maximum (MAX)
5. Square macro with proper parentheses
6. Absolute value macro (ABS)
7. Stringification macro (dprint)
8. Variable name printing macro (print_var)
9. Token pasting macro (paste)
10. Debug macro with line numbers (DEBUG)
```

- The program compiles and runs successfully, demonstrating various macro substitution techniques as described in the Kernighan and Ritchie text.

=== File Inclusion Demo: Managing Collections ===

Math Utilities Collection:
Add: 5 + 3 = 8
Multiply: 4 * 7 = 28
Factorial of 5 = 120
Is 17 prime? Yes
Is 15 prime? No

Array Utilities Collection:
Original array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Max value: 90
Min value: 11
Average: 36.86
Sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]

Combined Operations Example:
Data array: [5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 2, 7]
Prime numbers and their factorials:
  5! = 120
  3! = 6
  2! = 2
  7! = 5040

File inclusion makes it easy to organize and reuse collections of related functions!
