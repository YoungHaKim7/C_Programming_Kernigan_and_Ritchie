# I've successfully created 10 generic Rust code examples outside the main function. Here's what I've implemented:

  1. Generic Function: largest - finds the largest item in a slice
  2. Generic Struct: Point - coordinates with any types and methods to mix points
  3. Generic Enum: MyResult - a Result-like type for success/error values
  4. Generic Trait: Comparable - defines comparison behavior
  5. Generic Implementation: MyDisplay - adds methods to any Display type
  6. Multiple Type Parameters: compare_and_print - function with multiple generic types
  7. Lifetime + Generics: ImportantExcerpt - struct with lifetime and generic data
  8. Generic Operations: filter and map - functional programming utilities
  9. Generic Wrapper: Wrapper - optional value wrapper
  10. Generic Tree: TreeNode - binary search tree with generic values

- Each example demonstrates different aspects of Rust's generic programming features, including traits, structs, enums, functions, lifetimes, and bounds.
