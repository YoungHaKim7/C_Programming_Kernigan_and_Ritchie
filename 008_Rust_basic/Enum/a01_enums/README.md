# enum

  1. Basic enum usage - Simple Day enum with pattern matching
  2. Enum with different data types - Color enum with no data, String, and tuple variants
  3. Enum with String data - Status enum showing error handling
  4. IP address representation - IpAddress enum with different address formats
  5. Complex enum with multiple fields - PaymentMethod enum with various payment types
  6. Enum with different data structures - Message enum with struct-like and tuple variants
  7. Option enum usage - Custom Option<T> enum similar to Rust's built-in
  8. Result enum usage - Custom Result<T, E> enum for error handling
  9. Animal representation - Animal enum with different properties per variant
  10. Vehicle representation - Vehicle enum showing complex data structures

  Each example demonstrates different aspects of Rust enums including:
  - Basic pattern matching
  - Enums with associated data
  - Different data types per variant
  - Struct-like and tuple variants
  - Generic enums
